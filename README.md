This is my first Unity game (I now know that some things i did were unecesseri or complety wrong... I will probabily try to change them in the future, for now please bear with it).... AND a BIG part of this project was done using with base the stackoverflow so if there is something in the code that you think that i should give the credits to someone TALK WITH ME and i WILL GIVE THE REAL OWNERS THE CREDITS (the only reason why i didint already did this was because i didnt think about it while doing the code so right now i dont know wich parts are from where) IÂ´m really sorry for that.....
